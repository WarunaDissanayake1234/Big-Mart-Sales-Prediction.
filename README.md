# Big Mart Sales Prediction with XGBoost Regressor

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts sales using XGBoost Regressor on the BigMart Sales dataset.

## Overview

This project implements an XGBoost Regressor model to predict sales for BigMart using Python. Google Colab was utilized as the development environment.

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for running the code)
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WarunaDissanayake1234/Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn xgboost
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook or upload the provided notebook to Google Colab.
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook to load the BigMart Sales dataset, handle missing values (using mean for numerical and mode for text), preprocess the data, and build an XGBoost Regressor model to predict sales.
